# NC Games

This is the frontend project for the Northcoders bootcamp.

Some features are still in development. For the time being, you are logged in as a default user and have full access to the website's functionality.

This project uses an API that I developed which can be accessed on https://github.com/AdaamT/NC-games

Alternatively, a hosted version of the API is available at https://nc-games-adamt.herokuapp.com/api

## Running the project locally:

    // clone the repo
    git clone https://github.com/AdaamT/fe-nc-games

    // install dependencies
    npm install

    // start local react hosting
    npm run start

## Minimum Requirements

Node.js : v18.4.0
